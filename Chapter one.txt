1.7 Explain the two compilation phases of Java programs. 

Answer:

Phase 1: Compilation (Source Code → Bytecode)
	You write your program in a file ending with .java
	The Java compiler (javac) checks your code for syntax errors
	If everything is correct, it converts the code into bytecode
	The output file ends with .class
Example:
MyProgram.java  →  (javac)  →  MyProgram.class

Phase 2: Execution (Bytecode → Machine Code)
	The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) takes the .class file
	The JVM translates the bytecode into machine language
	The program runs on your computer
This second translation happens:
	Either through interpretation
	Or using a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler for speed
Example:
PhaseWhat HappensTool Used1.java → .classjavac (compiler)2.class → Machine CodeJVM



1.8 One of the world’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding.

Answer:

1. Object
An object is a real-world thing.
👉 A wristwatch is an object.
It exists physically and has properties and actions.
In Java thinking:
Watch myWatch = new Watch();
2. Attributes (Properties / State)
Attributes describe what the object has.
For a wristwatch, attributes could be:
	Color
	Brand
	Current time
	Battery level
	Strap material
	Water resistance
In programming:
String brand;
String color;
int hour;
int minute;
Note: Attributes represent the state of an object.

3. Behaviors (Methods)
Behaviors describe what the object can do.
A watch can:
	Show time
	Set time
	Set alarm
	Start stopwatch
	Turn on backlight
In programming:
setTime()
showTime()
setAlarm()

4. Class
A class is a blueprint.
If “Watch” is the class, then:
	All watches share common attributes and behaviors.
	Each physical watch is an instance (object) of that class.
In programming 
java
class Watch {
   // attributes + behaviors
}
Note: The class defines the structure; objects are created from.

5. Inheritance (Example: Alarm Clock)
Inheritance means creating a new class from an existing one.
For example:
	Basic Watch → shows time
	AlarmWatch → shows time + alarm
	SmartWatch → shows time + alarm + fitness tracking
So:
Watch
   ↓
AlarmWatch
   ↓
SmartWatch
Note: The alarm clock inherits from watch and adds new feature.
6. Modeling
Modeling means representing a real-world object in software.
When we create a Watch class with attributes and methods, we are:
👉 Modeling a real wristwatch inside a computer system.
We simplify reality to focus only on important features.
7. Messages
Objects communicate using messages.
In programming, this means calling methods.
Example:
java
myWatch.setTime(10, 30);
Note: Here, we are sending a message to the object:
👉 “Please set your time to 10:30.”
8. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means:
👉 Keeping data and methods together inside a class.
The watch keeps:
	Its time
	Its battery level
	Its internal mechanism
All bundled inside one unit (the object).
9. Interface
Interface means:
👉 What the user is allowed to interact with.
On a real watch:
	Buttons
	Touch screen
	Crown knob
You don’t touch the internal gears.
In programming:
Public methods are the interface.
10. Information Hiding
Information hiding means:
👉 Internal details are hidden from the outside.
For example:
	You don’t see how the watch calculates time.
	You don’t see the circuits or gears working.
	You just see the result (displayed time).
In Java:
java
private int hour;
private int minute;
Note: Users can’t directly change internal data — they must use methods.





Making a Difference

1.9 (Test-Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) 
Some scientists believe that carbon emissions, especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this can be combatted if individuals take steps to limit their use of carbon-based fuels. Organizations and individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/ and Carbon Footprint http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx provide carbon-footprint calculators. Test-drive these calculators to determine your carbon footprint. Exercises in later chapters will ask you to program your own carbon-footprint calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating carbon footprints. 

Answer:

To “test-drive” a carbon-footprint calculator and prepare to build your own, you need to understand:
	What data they collect
	The formulas used
	How emissions are converted to CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e)
Below is a clear breakdown to guide you 👇
________________________________________
🌍 What Is a Carbon Footprint?
A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (mainly CO₂) produced directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, or activity.
It’s usually measured in:
metric tons of CO₂ per year
________________________________________
🔥 Major Sources of Personal Carbon Emissions
Most calculators use these categories:
	Electricity usage
	Transportation (car, flights)
	Natural gas or cooking fuel
	Waste
	Diet (meat consumption)
________________________________________
🧮 Basic Carbon Footprint Formulas
The general formula is:
Carbon Emissions = Activity Data × Emission Factor
Where:
	Activity Data = how much energy or fuel you use
	Emission Factor = how much CO₂ is produced per unit
________________________________________
⚡ 1. Electricity Emissions
CO₂ = Electricity used (kWh) × Emission factor
Example:
If you use 900 kWh per month:
Emission factor (average global):
≈ 0.4 kg CO₂ per kWh
900 × 0.4 = 360 kg CO₂ per month
________________________________________
🚗 2. Car Fuel Emissions
For petrol (gasoline):
CO₂ = Liters of fuel × 2.31 kg CO₂ per liter
For diesel:
CO₂ = Liters × 2.68 kg CO₂ per liter
Example:
If you use 50 liters petrol:
50 × 2.31 = 115.5 kg CO₂
________________________________________
✈️ 3. Flight Emissions
Approximate formula:
CO₂ = Distance (km) × Emission factor
Short flight factor:
≈ 0.15–0.20 kg CO₂ per passenger per km
Example:
1,000 km flight:
1,000 × 0.18 = 180 kg CO₂
________________________________________
🔥 4. Natural Gas Emissions
CO₂ = Cubic meters × 2.0 kg CO₂
________________________________________
🗑️ 5. Waste Emissions
Some calculators estimate:
CO₂ = Waste generated (kg) × methane conversion factor
Methane is converted to CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e).
________________________________________
🥩 6. Diet Impact
High meat consumption increases emissions.
Approximate yearly averages:
	Vegan: ~1.5 tons CO₂
	Vegetarian: ~1.7 tons CO₂
	Mixed diet: ~2.5 tons CO₂+
	Heavy meat diet: ~3+ tons CO₂
________________________________________
📊 Final Carbon Footprint
Total footprint:
Total CO₂ = Electricity + Transport + Flights + Gas + Waste + Food
Converted to:
Metric tons per year (divide kg by 1000)
________________________________________
🧠 What You Should Notice (For Programming Later)
Most calculators:
	Ask for monthly usage
	Multiply by emission factors
	Add everything together
	Display result in tons/year
	Sometimes compare to national averages
________________________________________
💻 How You Would Program This Later (Java Idea)
You’d likely:
	Create a class called CarbonFootprint
	Add attributes:
	electricityUsage
	fuelUsed
	flightDistance
	Add methods:
	calculateElectricityEmission()
	calculateTransportEmission()
	calculateTotalEmission()


1.10 (Test-Drive: Body Mass Index Calculator) 
Obesity causes significant increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The United States Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/ bmicalc.htm. Use it to calculate your own BMI. A forthcoming exercise will ask you to program your own BMI calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating BMI. 

Answer:

To prepare for building your own BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, you mainly need to understand:
	The formula
	The BMI categories
	How to structure it in a program
Let’s go step by step 👇
________________________________________
📏 What Is BMI?
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from your weight and height to determine whether you are:
	Underweight
	Normal weight
	Overweight
	Obese
It is widely used by health organizations, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
________________________________________
🧮 BMI Formulas
There are two common formulas, depending on the measurement system.
________________________________________
✅ 1️⃣ Metric Formula (kg & meters)
BMI=(weight" 								" (kg))/(height^2 " 								" (m^2))

Example:
Weight = 70 kg
Height = 1.75 m
BMI=70/(1.75)^2 ┤ 
BMI=70/3.0625=22.86

________________________________________
✅ 2️⃣ Imperial Formula (pounds & inches)
BMI=(weight" 								" (lb)×703)/(height^2 " 								" (in^2))

The number 703 is a conversion factor.
Example:
Weight = 154 lb
Height = 69 inches
BMI=(154×703)/69^2 

________________________________________
📊 BMI Categories
BMI RangeCategoryBelow 18.5Underweight18.5 – 24.9Normal25.0 – 29.9Overweight30.0 and aboveObese________________________________________
💻 How You Would Program This (Logic Thinking)
Since you're building your software engineering foundation, here’s the logical flow:
	Ask user for weight
	Ask user for height
	Calculate BMI
	Use if-else to determine category
	Display result
________________________________________
🧠 Algorithm (Pseudocode)
START
INPUT weight
INPUT height
BMI = weight / (height * height)

IF BMI < 18.5
    PRINT "Underweight"
ELSE IF BMI < 25
    PRINT "Normal"
ELSE IF BMI < 30
    PRINT "Overweight"
ELSE
    PRINT "Obese"
END
________________________________________
⚠️ Important Note
BMI:
	Does not measure body fat directly
	May not be accurate for athletes (high muscle mass)
	Is mainly a screening tool


1.11 (Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles)

1.12 (Gender Neutrality) 
Many people want to eliminate sexism in all forms of communication. You’ve been asked to create a program that can process a paragraph of text and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming that you’ve been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g., replace both “wife” and “husband” with “spouse,” “man” and “woman” with “person,” “daughter” and “son” with “child”), explain the procedure you’d use to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild?” You’ll soon learn that a more formal term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them. We’ll show how to develop algorithms then convert them to Java programs which can be run on computers.

Anwser:

Step-by-Step Procedure (Algorithm)
Assume you are given:
wife → spouse
husband → spouse
man → person
woman → person
daughter → child
son → child
________________________________________
🔹 Step 1: Store the Replacement Pairs
Create a list (or dictionary) that stores:
	Gender-specific word
	Corresponding gender-neutral word
Example structure:
("wife", "spouse")
("husband", "spouse")
("man", "person")
...
________________________________________
🔹 Step 2: Read the Paragraph
Take the paragraph as input.
Example:
The woman told her husband that their daughter is a smart young woman.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 3: Process the Text Word by Word
Split the paragraph into individual words.
For each word:
	Check if it matches a gender-specific word.
	If it does → replace it.
	If it doesn’t → leave it unchanged.
________________________________________
🔹 Step 4: Preserve Case (Optional Improvement)
If the word is capitalized:
	“Woman” → “Person”
So the program should:
	Detect capitalization
	Apply replacement
	Restore original case format
________________________________________
🔹 Step 5: Rebuild the Paragraph
Join the modified words back into a full paragraph.
________________________________________
🧠 Example Transformation
Original:
The woman told her husband that their daughter is a smart young woman.
After replacement:
The person told her spouse that their child is a smart young person.
________________________________________
⚠️ Why Might It Produce “woperchild”?
This happens if you use naïve substring replacement instead of whole-word replacement.
For example:
If you blindly replace:
man → person
son → child
And you process the word:
woman
Step 1: Replace "man" inside "woman"
wo + person = woperson
Step 2: Replace "son" inside "woperson"
wo + perchild = woperchild
So:
woman → woperchild  ❌
This happens because:
	The algorithm replaces parts of words
	Instead of matching complete words only
_______________________________________
✅ How to Prevent That Problem
The algorithm must:
	Replace only whole words
	Not replace parts of longer words
	Use word boundaries
Better logic:
Instead of:
Replace all occurrences of "man"
Use:
Replace only if the word equals "man"
________________________________________
🧠 Improved Algorithm
	Read paragraph.
	Split into words.
	For each word:
	Remove punctuation temporarily.
	Compare the word exactly with dictionary keys.
	If match → replace.
	Reattach punctuation.
	Join words back together.
	Output result.
________________________________________
💻 If You Later Implement in Java
You would likely:
	Use a HashMap<String, String>
	Use .split(" ")
	Compare using .equalsIgnoreCase()
	Avoid .replace() on full string blindly
________________________________________
📌 Key Learning Point
This exercise teaches:
	The importance of careful algorithm design
	Why order of operations matters
	Why simple text replacement can produce unintended results
	The need to think about edge cases
