 2.24 (Largest and Smallest Integers) Write an application that reads five integers and determines and prints the largest and smallest integers in the group. Use only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter. 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FiveNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int number, largest, smallest;

        System.out.print("Enter integer: ");
        number = input.nextInt();
        largest = number;
        smallest = number;

        for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter integer: ");
            number = input.nextInt();

    }
}

2.25 (Odd or Even) Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints whether it’s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of 2. Any multiple of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.]
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class OddEven {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int number;

        System.out.print("Enter integer: ");
        number = input.nextInt();

        if (number % 2 == 0)

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int num1, num2;

        System.out.print("Enter first integer: ");
        num1 = input.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter second integer: ");
        num2 = input.nextInt();

        if (num1 % num2 == 0)
            System.out.println("First is multiple of second");
        else
            System.out.println("First is not multiple of second");
    }
}

        System.out.println(" * * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println("* * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println(" * * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println("* * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println(" * * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println("* * * * * * * *");
        System.out.println(" * * * * * * * *");
    }
}

2.28 (Diameter, Circumference and Area of a Circle) Here’s a peek ahead. In this chapter, you learned about integers and the type int. Java can also represent floating-point numbers that contain decimal points, such as 3.14159. Write an application that inputs from the user the radius of a circle as an integer and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and area using the floating-point value 3.14159 for π. Use the techniques shown in Fig. 2.7. [Note: You may also use the predefined constant Math.PI for the value of π. This constant is more precise than the value 3.14159. Class Math is defined in package java.lang. Classes in that package are imported automatically, so you do not need to import class Math to use it.] Use the following formulas (r is the radius): diameter = 2r circumference = 2πr area = πr2 Do not store the results of each calculation in a variable. Rather, specify each calculation as the value that will be output in a System.out.printf statement. The values produced by the circumference and area calculations are floating-point numbers. Such values can be output with the format specifier %f in a System.out.printf statement. 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Circle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int r;

        System.out.print("Enter radius: ");
        r = input.nextInt();

        System.out.printf("Diameter: %d%n", 2 * r);
        System.out.printf("Circumference: %f%n", 2 * Math.PI * r);
        System.out.printf("Area: %f%n", Math.PI * r * r);
    }
}


2.29 (Integer Value of a Character) Here’s another peek ahead. In this chapter, you learned about integers and the type int. Java can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable variety of special symbols. Every character has a corresponding integer representation. The set of characters a computer uses together with the corresponding integer representations for those characters is called that computer’s character set. You can indicate a character value in a program simply by enclosing that character in single quotes, as in 'A'. You can determine a character’s integer equivalent by preceding that character with (int), as in (int) 'A' An operator of this form is called a cast operator. (You’ll learn about cast operators in Chapter 3.) The following statement outputs a character and its integer equivalent: System.out.printf("The character %c has the value %d%n", 'A', ((int) 'A')); When the preceding statement executes, it displays the character A and the value 65 (from the Unicode® character set) as part of the string. The format specifier %c is a placeholder for a character (in this case, the character 'A'). Using statements similar to the one shown earlier in this exercise, write an application that displays the integer equivalents of some uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits and special symbols. Display the integer equivalents of the following: ABCabc012$*+/ and the blank character.
Answer: 

public class CharacterValues {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'A', (int)'A');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'B', (int)'B');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'C', (int)'C');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'a', (int)'a');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'b', (int)'b');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", 'c', (int)'c');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", '0', (int)'0');
        System.out.printf("%c = %d%n", '$', (int)'$');
    }
}

 2.30 (Separating the Digits in an Integer) Write an application that inputs one number consisting of five digits from the user, separates the number into its individual digits and prints the digits separated from one another by three spaces each. For example, if the user types in the number 42339, the program should print
 

 Assume that the user enters the correct number of digits. What happens when you enter a number with more than five digits? What happens when you enter a number with fewer than five digits? [Hint: It’s possible to do this exercise with the techniques you learned in this chapter. You’ll need to use both division and remainder operations to “pick off ” each digit.] 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class SeparateDigits {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int number;

        System.out.print("Enter five-digit integer: ");
        number = input.nextInt();

        System.out.printf("%d   %d   %d   %d   %d%n",
                number / 10000,
                number / 1000 % 10,
                number / 100 % 10,
                number / 10 % 10,
                number % 10);
    }
}


2.31 (Table of Squares and Cubes) Using only the programming techniques you learned in this chapter, write an application that calculates the squares and cubes of the numbers from 0 to 10 and prints the resulting values in table format, as shown below.
 
Answer: 

public class SquaresCubes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Number  Square  Cube");

        for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
            System.out.printf("%d       %d       %d%n", i, i*i, i*i*i);
    }
}

 2.32 (Negative, Positive and Zero Values) Write a program that inputs five numbers and determines and prints the number of negative numbers input, the number of positive numbers input and the number of zeros input. 

Making a Difference 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int number, positive = 0, negative = 0, zero = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter number: ");
            number = input.nextInt();

            if (number > 0) positive++;
            else if (number < 0) negative++;
            else zero++;
        }

        System.out.printf("Positive: %d%n", positive);
        System.out.printf("Negative: %d%n", negative);
        System.out.printf("Zero: %d%n", zero);
    }
}

2.33 (Body Mass Index Calculator) We introduced the body mass index (BMI) calculator in Exercise 1.10. The formulas for calculating BMI are
  
Create a BMI calculator that reads the user’s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer, the user’s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and displays the user’s body mass index. Also, display the following information from the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the user can evaluate his/her BMI: 
 
 [Note: In this chapter, you learned to use the int type to represent whole numbers. The BMI calculations when done with int values will both produce whole-number results. In Chapter 3, you’ll learn to use the double type to represent numbers with decimal points. When the BMI calculations are performed with doubles, they’ll both produce numbers with decimal points—these are called “floating-point” numbers.] 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

2.34 (World Population Growth Calculator) Use the web to determine the current world population and the annual world population growth rate. Write an application that inputs these values, then displays the estimated world population after one, two, three, four and five years. 
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Population {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        double population, rate;

        System.out.print("Enter current population: ");
        population = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter annual growth rate (e.g., 0.01 for 1%): ");
        rate = input.nextDouble();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            population = population + (population * rate);
            System.out.printf("Year %d: %.0f%n", i, population);
        }
    }
}


2.35 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by carpooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information and display the user’s cost per day of driving to work:
 a) Total miles driven per day. 
b) Cost per gallon of gasoline. 
c) Average miles per gallon.
d) Parking fees per day. 
e) Tolls per day
Answer: 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CarPool {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        double miles, costPerGallon, milesPerGallon, parking, tolls;

        System.out.print("Total miles per day: ");
        miles = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Cost per gallon: ");
        costPerGallon = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Miles per gallon: ");
        milesPerGallon = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Parking fees per day: ");
        parking = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Tolls per day: ");
        tolls = input.nextDouble();

        double dailyCost = (miles / milesPerGallon) * costPerGallon + parking + tolls;

        System.out.printf("Daily driving cost: %.2f%n", dailyCost);
    }
}
