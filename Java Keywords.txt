📌 Java Keywords and Their Functions

1. abstract – Used to declare incomplete classes or methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

2. assert – Tests if a condition is true; used for debugging.

3. boolean – Declares a variable that stores true or false.

4. break – Stops a loop or switch statement immediately.

5. byte – Declares a small integer variable (8-bit).

6. case – Defines a branch inside a switch statement.

7. catch – Handles an exception after try.

8. char – Stores a single character (like 'A').

9. class – Defines a blueprint for creating objects.

10.const – Reserved word (not used in Java).

11. continue – Skips the current loop iteration and moves to the next one.

12. default – Executes when no case matches in a switch.

13. do – Starts a do-while loop (runs at least once).

14. double – Stores decimal numbers (64-bit floating point).

15. else – Runs when an if condition is false.

16. enum – Defines a fixed set of constants.

17. extends – Allows one class to inherit from another.

18. final – Prevents change (variable can’t change, method can’t override, class can’t inherit).

19. finally – Block that always runs after try-catch.

20. float – Stores decimal numbers (32-bit floating point).

21. for – Creates a loop with initialization, condition, and update.

22. goto – Reserved but not used in Java.

23. if – Executes code when a condition is true.

24. implements – Used when a class follows an interface.

25. import – Brings other classes/packages into your file.

26. instanceof – Checks if an object belongs to a certain class.

27. int – Stores whole numbers (32-bit).

28. interface – Defines methods a class must implement.

29. long – Stores large whole numbers (64-bit).

30. native – Indicates method is written in another language (like C).

31. new – Creates a new object.

32. package – Groups related classes together.

33. private – Accessible only within the same class.

34. protected – Accessible within the package and subclasses.

35. public – Accessible everywhere.

36. return – Sends a value back from a method.

37. short – Stores small whole numbers (16-bit).

38. static – Belongs to the class, not to objects.

39. strictfp – Controls floating-point precision strictly.

40. super – Refers to the parent class.

41. switch – Selects one option from many choices.

42. synchronized – Controls access in multi-threading.

43. this – Refers to the current object.

44. throw – Manually throws an exception.

45. throws – Declares exceptions a method may pass.

46. transient – Prevents variable from being serialized.

47. try – Wraps code that might cause an exception.

48. void – Means a method returns nothing.

49. volatile – Ensures variable updates are visible across threads.

50. while – Repeats code while condition is true.

51. true – Boolean true value.

52. false – Boolean false value.

53. null – Represents no object reference.

54. _ (underscore) – Reserved keyword (not usable as identifier from Java 9).

55. var – Used for local variable type inference (Java 10+).

56. record – Declares immutable data classes (Java 14+).

57. yield – Returns a value from a switch expression (Java 14+).
